## Wings For World   
This is my very first project, which I started develop in July 2016. After almost 1,5 years break, I decided to continue with it again.  

### Important features  
Fully featured backend - Node JS with NoSQL database MongoDB + Web Sockets.   
Client & Server written 100% with Typescript.   
Admin Panel - Angular Framework.
